Extra Credit Work


- binded the video into the vue data property in the JS filetag
- to isolate for one video/thumbnail, I went to my local host and opened up the site. I went to the VUE console and edited the array to isolate where I would need to make a change
- I edited the query in the php file to only show one thumbnail and video
- Added a v-for tag to the li parent tag to the video, and addded the tag for the thumbnail
- rebuilt CSS in SASS with adding modules
- included Gulp to the project
